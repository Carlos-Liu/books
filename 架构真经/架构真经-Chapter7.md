- 从失败而不是成功中能学习到更多的东西
- 隐藏失败，结果必然是反复失败  
- 把分享失败作为最佳实践  
如何从失败中吸取教训？ 
- 营造**开放**和**诚实沟通**的环境
- 具备能帮助我们反复从错误和失败中吸取教训的**轻量级**过程


- Active/Active Architecture
  > What is active-active?  There are a couple of different active/active architectures:  **active/active data centers and active/active applications**.  In order to have an active/active application, you must first have active/active data centers.  When you have the two together, you have the ability to deliver a new level of service called **Continuous Availability**.  
  > Continuously Available or Active/Active architectures are deployed to **focus on uptime rather than recovery**.  That is to say *we discuss the reliability of the architecture rather than how quickly it can recover from an outage*.   If your infrastructure has all of the tenants of the active/active data center and application architectures — where a fault in a single location does not affect the ability of the application to continue to perform in another location — then you can have a Continuously Available solution. [ref](https://infocus.dellemc.com/john_linse/what-is-activeactive-and-how-can-it-improve-business-continuity/) 
 > Continuously Available or Active/Active applications give you the ability to perform maintenance on applications without disrupting service to your user community.  **The architecture also provides diverse production locations assuring that a complete outage of one data center does not disrupt your ability to deliver “always-on and always-available” application services.**
  
  - 组织必须在深度和广度上学习。**深度**来于多问“为什么”，直到原因清楚。**广度**来于需要什么样的培训、人、组织和流程（不仅局限于技术和架构层面）。
